Dear students, here is quick reminding:

Create the virtual environment (let's name it “env” by convention) 
py -m venv env
we used py, python, python3, py3
Activate the virtual environment
env\Scripts\activate

We need to import (install) pymongo (Make sure to install it inside the virtual environment)
(env) pip install pymongo
